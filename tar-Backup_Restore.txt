# How to use tar to backup and restore folders and servers #
----------------------------
The tar command also known as a "tape archive" is used to compress files and folders in Linux operating systems. 
It creates a tar archive by converting a group of files or directories into a single compressed file. 
It allows you to decompress the tar archive, print a list of all files included in the archive and also add an additional 
file to the archive. Generally, the tar command is used by the system administrator to create and restore a backup on the server.

# Tar Command Syntax
The basic syntax of the tar command is shown below:

tar [option] [archive-name] [files or directories]
A brief explanation of each option is shown below:

-c : Used to create a tar archive.
-x : Used to extract from the tar archive.
-t : Used to display a list of files inside tar archive.
-r : Used to add an additional file in the tar archive.
-W : Used to verify a tar archive.
-z : Used to create a tar archive using gzip.
-j : Used to create a tar archive using bzip.
-v : Used to display verbose information.
-f : Used to specify archive file name.
--------------------------------------
# Create a Tar Archive
To create a tar archive named compress-file.tar from a single file named file1.txt, run the following command:

tar -cf compress-file.tar file1.txt
To create a tar archive named compress-file.tar from multiple files named file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt, run the following command:

tar -cf compress-file.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
If you want to create a tar archive of any directory, run the following command:

tar -cf compress-dir.tar dir1
This will create a tar archive named compress-dir.tar from a directory dir1.
--------------------------------------
# Create a Tar Bz2 Archive
You can also compress a tar file using a bz2 algorithm. You will need to specify tar.bz2 at the end of the archive name.

The following command will create a tar.bz2 archive from the directory /etc.

tar -cjf compress.tar.bz2 /etc
You can also specify -v option to display the compression process in verbose.
--------------------------------------
# Create a Tar Gzip Archive
You can use the -z option with the tar command to create a tar archive in gzip format.

The following command will create a tar.gz archive from the /usr directory.

tar -cxf compress.tar.gz /usr
--------------------------------------
# List Content of Tar Archive
You can use the option -t with the tar command to display a list of content available in the tar archive file.

The following example will display a list of content inside the compress-dir.tar file:

tar -tvf compress-dir.tar
--------------------------------------
# Extract a Tar Archive
You can use the option -x with the tar command to uncompress the tar archive.

For example, run the following command to uncompress a compress-dir.tar file:

tar -xvf compress-dir.tar
If you want to extract a single file named file1.txt from the compress-dir.tar file, run the following command:

tar -xvf compress-dir.tar file1.txt
--------------------------------------
# Extract a Tar Gzip Archive
You can use the option -z with the tar command to extract or uncompress the Gzip archive file.

For example, run the following command to extract the compress.tar.gz archive file:

tar -xzvf compress.tar.gz
--------------------------------------
# Extract a Tar Bz2 Archive
You can use the option -j with the tar command to extract from the Bz2 archive.

For example, run the following command to extract the compress.tar.bz2 archive file.

tar -xjvf compress.tar.bz2
--------------------------------------
# Extract a Tar Archive in a Different Directory
When you extract any tar archive it will extract the archive contents in the current directory. You can use the option -C with the tar command to extract the tar archive to the specified directory.

For example, run the following command to extract the compress-dir.tar content to /opt directory:

tar -xvf compress-dir.tar -C /opt
--------------------------------------
# Add and Remove a File from a Tar Archive
You can also add and remove specific files and directories to an existing tar archive. You can use the option -r to add a file to a tar archive and use the option --delete to delete a file from the tar archive.

For example, to add a new file named file6.txt to the archive name compress-dir.tar, run the following command:

tar -rvf compress-dir.tar file6.txt
To remove a file named file1.txt from the archive named compress-dir.tar, run the following command:

tar --delete -f compress-dir.tar file1.txt
--------------------------------------
# Extract Multiple Files from the Tar Archive
You can use a wildcard to extract a group of files from the tar archive.

For example, extract all files that match the pattern .html from the archive compress.tar.gz use the following command:

tar -xvzf compress.tar.gz --wildcards  '*.html'
